Twin orphans grow up in a remote village.
They don't know much about their origins, but their foster grandfather never tells them anything.
All they have of their real parents are the pendants they have always worm.
Their peaceful world crumbles when they're forced to leave the country â€” and thus are forced to leave their village.
